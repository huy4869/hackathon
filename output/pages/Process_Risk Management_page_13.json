For instance, if compliance impact for an event is \"HIGH\", while other impacts are either lower \nor not applicable, the impact level for that event will be \"HIGH\".  Both impact and probability shall be \nevaluated in a \"what if\" scenario, i.e not considering existing countermeasures. Risk of fire (its impact \nand probability) should not be considered a smoke detection system in place, as well as risk of cyber-\nattack should be assessed without taking into account the effectiveness of the information security \nsystem in place. \nProbability is valued considering known past events (as absolute numbers or as percentage of cases), \nand chances that the event will occur in the foreseeable future (short/medium/long term). \nForecast: This evaluation gives an estimate of an event occurrence in the future. \nLevel of risk \nOnce the levels of Likelihood and Impact are stablished, the resulting risk level is automatically set within \nfollowing the Risk Matrix, resulting in the final level of risk. \n \nLikelihood \nForecast \nStatistic \nMeasurability \nVERY HIGH \nThe event will probably occur \nin the short term, frequently \nnext year \nThe event occurred at least \nonce every year in the past \nfive years \nThe event occurs in more \nthan 50% of cases \nHIGH    \nThe event will probably occur \nin the short term, sometimes \nnext year \nThe event occurred at least \nonce every year in the past \nthree years \nThe event occurs in between \n20% and 50% of cases \nMEDIUM \nThe event will probably occur \nin \nthe \nmedium \nterm, \nsometimes in the next five \nyears \nThe event occurred at least \nonce in the past three years \nThe event occurs in between \n5% and 20% of case \nLOW   \nThe event will probably occur \nin the long-term (in more than \nfive years) \nThe event occurred at least \nonce in the past five years  \nThe event occurs in between \n1% and 5% of cases \nREMOTE   \nThe event will probably not \noccur in the long-term (five \nyears or more) \nThe event occurred at least \nonce in the past five years \nThe event occurs in less \nthan 1% of cases \nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX",
