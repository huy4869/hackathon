The definition \nof assets must be carried out with an adequate level of detail so that sufficient information is provided \nfor the evaluation of information security risks. The information to be collected in this task typically falls \ninto the following categories:  \n• \nBusiness processes involving assets.  \n• \nOwners, users, and asset support teams.  \n• \nType, criticality, and sensitivity of information.  \n• \nAsset location and function.  \n• \nSupport infrastructure (e.g., network, security).  \n• \nRequirements (e.g., legal, regulatory, \n policies and regulations).  \nThreats and vulnerabilities identification  \nTo identify the likelihood and impact of the risks to which identified information assets are exposed, \nthreats and potential vulnerabilities must be considered:  \n• \nThreat - Potential cause of an unwanted incident, which can exploit a vulnerability to damage \nassets such as information, processes, and systems and therefore \n. Threats can \nbe of natural origin and can be accidental or deliberate and can arise from the \n \ninternal or external environment.  \n• \nVulnerability - A failure or weakness in procedures, design, implementation, operation, or \ninternal control, which may result in an Information Security breach or violation of rules defined \nin Information Security regulations.  \nThis task aims at identifying possible information security threats and their sources, considering the \nfollowing aspects:  \n• \nThreats should be identified generically and by type (e.g., unauthorized actions, physical harm, \ntechnical failures) and therefore, where appropriate, individual threats should be identified within \na generic class.  \n• \nSome threats may affect more than one asset. In some cases, they may cause different impacts \ndepending on the assets that are affected. \n• \nInformation can be obtained by reviewing incidents, gathering from \n elements \n(e.g., asset owners, users, technical teams) and analysing other sources, including external \nthreat catalogues. \n• \nRelevant threats are constantly evolving, especially if the business environment or information \nsystems change. \nAs a result of performing this task, a list of threats that can be exploited by vulnerabilities, associated \nwith each asset under analysis, is obtained. \nControls identification  \nThis task aims at identifying information security controls (existing or planned) that aim to ensure a \nreduction in the level of risk of assets. The identification should be carried out based on existing \nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX",
