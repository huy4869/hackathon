This \nbackground must be comprised of the relevant circumstances, both internal and external to the \ncompany: \n• \nDescription of process or asset that’s being assessed and its contribution in the overall business \noperations of the company. Person or area responsible for its management. Internal \ndependencies relevant to its proper functioning. Determine the relevant internal stakeholders \nthat must be involved in the assessment. \n• \nRequirements defined by Top Management (e.g., new legal, regulatory, or contractual \nrequirements applicable to \n, new services, new infrastructure, new relations with \nexternal entities). \n• \nInformation obtained in previous iterations of the Risk Management process. \n• \nIdentify known or suspected threats the process or asset may be subject to (can be detected in \nperiodic monitoring activities or through information obtained externally to \n). \n• \nInformation obtained through regular meetings with the heads of the business support teams \n(Office, HR, Legal, IT Infrastructures and Procurement), as well as the heads of the \n \nCorporate Security Teams. \n2.3.2 IDENTIFY AND ASSESS INHERENT RISKS \n2.3.2.1 Identify Inherent Risks \nRisk identification is carried out on any set of tasks and its objective is to determine which events may \nhave a potential impact on\n and to gain knowledge about how, when, and why this impact \nmay occur.

Availability - to ensure that the information is accessible and usable whenever \nrequested by an authorized entity. \n• \nTraceability - to ensure that the actions of an entity can be attributed exclusively to that entity. \nAuthenticity - to ensure that an entity is who it claims to be or that it guarantees the source of \nthe data.  \nThe tasks that constitute this activity are: \nAsset identification  \nIt will be up to the team involved in this activity to define the scope of the assets to be considered, \nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX",
