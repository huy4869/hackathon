The effect of \nimplementing a control can be estimated by gauging how it reduces the likelihood of the threat \nand the ease of exploiting the vulnerability or the impact of the incident.  \n• \nPlanned controls - controls in the process of implementation should be identified or defined for \nthe near future in planning. \n2.3.2.2 Assess Inherent Risks \nThe main objective of this activity is to classify the level of inherent risk based on the probability and \nconsequence of the threat's achievement.  \nInherent Risks assessment should consider how often threats are realized and how easily vulnerabilities \ncan be exploited, considering factors such as:  \n• \nExperience and statistics applicable to the probability of threats. \n• \nSources of deliberate threats: the motivation and capabilities, which change over time, and \nresources available to possible attacks, as well as the perception of asset vulnerability. \n• \nSources of accidental threats: geographical factors such as occurrence of extreme weather \nconditions and other factors that may influence human error and equipment malfunction. \n• \nVulnerabilities, individually or in aggregate.  \n• \nExisting controls and how to effectively reduce vulnerabilities.  \n• \nConcerns of stakeholders.  \nThe analysis of the level of risk is based on a two-dimensional analysis Impact and Likelihood:  \nImpact (Identification of consequences)  \nThe assessment made for any given risk must have the most objective approach to the foreseeable \nimpact it could make in the event of materializing, based on the Asset or Process owner’s and the Risk \nManager’s knowledge and experience, as well as a critical analysis of the sector. \nThe impact must be based on at least one of the following categories. In the event that more than one \ncategory is assessed, the level of impact will be based on the one with the highest value. \nThe following describes the levels of impact of a risk occurring: \nImpact Level \nEconomic results \nOperations \nReputation \nCompliance \nSafety of \nemployees \nVERY HIGH \nThe potential \ndamage caused by \nthe event may be \nmore than 20% of \nyearly operating \nincome \nBusiness continuity \nis endangered. \nVery negative \nimpact on the \nachievement of \nCompany \nobjectives. Long \ninterruption of key \nprocesses.
