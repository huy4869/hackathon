Residual risk is obtained from the new values. \n• \nNumerous controls are no guarantee of a significant reduction in risk.  \n• \nInherent Very High Risks may not be lowered more than Medium Residual Risk level. \nThe following describes the analysis to determine the level of reduction provided by control measures:  \nLikelihood \nImpact \nInherent/Residual Risk \nControl in place \nLevel \nScore \nLevel \nScore \nLevel \nScore \nLevel \nScore \nREMOTE \n1 \nNEGLIGIBLE \n1 \nINSIGNIFICANT \n<=4 \nNOT EFFECTIVE \n1 \nLOW \n2 \nLOW \n3 \nLOW \n>4 \nPARTIALLY EFFECTIVE \n0.7 \nMEDIUM \n3 \nMEDIUM \n7 \nMEDIUM \n>10 \nEFFECTIVE \n0.2 \nHIGH \n4 \nSIGNIFICANT \n10 \nHIGH \n>20 \n  \n  \nVERY HIGH \n5 \nVERY HIGH \n12 \nVERY HIGH \n>35 \n  \n  \nTable 2.6 – Level of reduction risk \n \nThe Risk Value is obtained based on the following formula:  \nInherent Risk Value = Likelihood x Impact \nResidual Risk Value = Inherent Risk Value x Level of control for the risk (Control in place) \n2.3.4.2 Treatment Decision \nRisk Appetite \nThe risk appetite is the amount of risk the organization is willing to pursue or accept. It is set by the Risk \nGoverning Bodies at \n level. \nThe residual risk level must be contrasted with the current risk appetite in order to determine the actions \nto take regarding any given risk. \nAccept/Tolerate \nThe residual risk is considered acceptable by the roles driving the risk assessment. Meaning that the \nto assess risk thresholds and/or alerts are set \nand monitored; countermeasures: procedures \nand actions are in place aiming to handle \nprevention, detection of events and mitigation \nof impacts. \nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX-XXX\nXXX",
