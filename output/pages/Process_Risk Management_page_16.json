Therefore, the asset or process that generates the risk must be \nterminated. \nThe scenario to terminate any given activity due to the level of risk must be thoroughly analysed for \nimpacts on the overall objectives of the organization and raised for decision to the relevant instances. \n \nAlthough these considerations may affect the decision, considering the level of risk obtained in the \n\"Determine residual risk\" activity, measures should be implemented for risks with a \"Very High\" or \n\"High\" level, as defined in the following table: \nRisk \nAction  \nPrioritization \ncriteria \nVERY HIGH \nThe risk cannot be accepted. It must be prioritized and treated within 3 \nmonths. \n1 \nHIGH    \nThe risk cannot be accepted.
